## 📚 Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental guidelines for good object-oriented design.

## 🔍 Overview of SOLID Principles

| Principle | Description | Key Benefit |
|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| [🧩 **S**ingle Responsibility (SRP)](./01-single-responsibility.md) | A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. | Code that is easier to understand, maintain, and test. ✨ |
| [🔓 **O**pen/Closed (OCP)](./02-open-closed.md) | Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. | New functionality can be added without changing existing code, reducing the risk of regressions. 🚀 |
| [🔄 **L**iskov Substitution (LSP)](./03-liskov-substitution.md) | Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. | Better inheritance hierarchies and more reliable polymorphism. 🎯 |
| [🧪 **I**nterface Segregation (ISP)](./04-interface-segregation.md) | A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. | More focused and cohesive interfaces that are easier to implement and maintain. 📐 |
| [🛠️ **D**ependency Inversion (DIP)](./05-dependency-inversion.md) | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. | Loose coupling between components, making them easier to replace and test. 🔌 |
