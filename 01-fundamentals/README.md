# 📚 Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming in PHP

This section covers the core concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential before moving on to more advanced topics.

## 📋 Topics

1. [🏛️ Classes and Objects](./01-classes-and-objects.md) - Foundational building blocks of OOP
2. [🧰 Properties and Methods](./02-properties-and-methods.md) - Data and behaviors that define class capabilities
3. [📦 Encapsulation](./03-encapsulation.md) - Protecting data through access control
4. [👨‍👦 Inheritance](./04-inheritance.md) - Creating hierarchical class relationships
5. [🦎 Polymorphism](./05-polymorphism.md) - Flexibility in how objects respond to methods
6. [📝 Abstraction](./06-abstraction.md) - Creating templates for derived classes
7. [🔌 Interfaces](./07-interfaces.md) - Contracts for class implementation
8. [📁 Namespaces](./08-namespaces.md) - Organization and prevention of name collisions
9. [📋 PHP OOP Cheat Sheet](./10-oop-cheat-sheet.md) - Quick reference for all OOP concepts

## 🚀 Why Learn OOP in PHP?

Object-Oriented Programming offers several advantages:

- **Organization**: Helps structure larger programs in a logical way
- **Reusability**: Promotes code reuse through inheritance and composition
- **Maintainability**: Makes code easier to update and maintain
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to expand projects over time
- **Modern PHP Development**: Most modern PHP frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.) are built using OOP principles

## 🛠️ How to Use This Section

Each topic builds on the previous ones, so it's recommended to go through them in order. Each file contains:

- ✅ Conceptual explanations
- ✅ PHP code examples
- ✅ Best practices and common pitfalls
- ✅ Practical use cases

> **Note:** After studying the fundamentals, you'll be prepared to move on to [Advanced OOP Concepts](../02-advanced-oop/README.md).
