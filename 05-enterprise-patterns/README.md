# Enterprise Patterns in PHP 🏗️

This section covers enterprise-level architectural patterns commonly used in PHP applications.

## Why Enterprise Patterns? 🤔

Enterprise patterns address challenges that arise in large-scale applications:

- **📋 Maintainability**: They promote separation of concerns and code organization
- **🧪 Testability**: They make the code more testable through dependency inversion
- **📈 Scalability**: They allow for better resource utilization and performance optimization
- **👥 Team Collaboration**: They provide a common vocabulary and structure for development teams
- **💼 Business Logic Isolation**: They help separate business logic from infrastructure concerns

## Understanding Enterprise Patterns 📚

Enterprise patterns are higher-level architectural patterns that help structure applications to be more maintainable, scalable, and testable. Unlike design patterns which focus on solving specific design problems, enterprise patterns provide guidance on organizing larger pieces of applications.

These patterns are especially important in enterprise-level PHP applications that deal with complex domains, multiple integrations, and large teams.

## Pattern Catalog 📘

### 📂 Data Source Architectural Patterns

1. [**Repository Pattern**](./01-repository-pattern.md) - Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface
2. [**Unit of Work**](./02-unit-of-work.md) - Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction
3. [**Data Mapper**](./04-data-mapper.md) - Separates domain objects from their persistence representation
4. [**Active Record**](./05-active-record.md) - Combines domain logic and database access in a single class
5. [**Lazy Loading**](./12-lazy-loading.md) - ⏰ Defers initialization of resources until they're actually needed

### 🧠 Domain Logic Patterns

6. [**Domain Model**](./06-domain-model.md) - 🏛️ Models complex business logic with rich object relationships
7. [**Service Layer**](./03-service-layer.md) - 🛠️ Defines application's boundary and entry points for operations
8. [**Specification Pattern**](./10-specification-pattern.md) - 📋 Encapsulates business rules in composable objects

### 🌐 Distributed System Patterns

9. [**Circuit Breaker**](./13-circuit-breaker.md) - 🔌 Prevents system failures by interrupting failing operations
10. [**Saga Pattern**](./14-saga.md) - 🔄 Manages failures in distributed transactions with compensating actions
11. [**Event Sourcing**](./07-event-sourcing.md) - 📊 Captures all changes as a sequence of events
12. [**CQRS**](./08-cqrs.md) - 📈 Separates read and write operations for better scalability
13. [**Publish-Subscribe**](./19-pub-sub.md) - 📡 Enables asynchronous communication between components

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns

14. [**Dependency Injection Container**](./09-dependency-injection-container.md) - 💉 Centrally manages object creation and dependencies
15. [**Dependency Injection**](./09a-dependency-injection-explained.md) - 💉 Provides objects with their dependencies from outside
16. [**Front Controller**](./15-front-controller.md) - 🚪 Handles all requests through a single entry point
17. [**Adapter/Wrapper**](./20-adapter.md) - 🔌 Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
18. [**Middleware**](./17-middleware.md) - 🧩 Processes requests/responses in a pipeline

### 📨 Communication Patterns

19. [**Data Transfer Object (DTO)**](./11-data-transfer-object.md) - 📦 Encapsulates data for transport between systems
20. [**Observer**](./18-observer.md) - 👀 Notifies objects about state changes
21. [**Inversion of Control (IoC)**](./16-inversion-of-control.md) - 🔄 Transfers control of objects to a container
