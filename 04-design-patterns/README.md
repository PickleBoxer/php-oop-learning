# 🧩 Design Patterns in PHP

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. This section covers the most important design patterns and how to implement them in PHP.

## 📚 Categories

### 🏭 Creational Patterns
1. [Factory Method](./01-creational/01-factory-method.md) - Creates objects without specifying exact class
2. [Abstract Factory](./01-creational/02-abstract-factory.md) - Creates families of related objects
3. [Builder](./01-creational/03-builder.md) - Constructs complex objects step by step
4. [Singleton](./01-creational/04-singleton.md) - Ensures a class has only one instance
5. [Prototype](./01-creational/05-prototype.md) - Creates objects by cloning existing ones

### 🔌 Structural Patterns
1. [Adapter](./02-structural/01-adapter.md) - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
2. [Bridge](./02-structural/02-bridge.md) - Separates abstraction from implementation
3. [Composite](./02-structural/03-composite.md) - Composes objects into tree structures
4. [Decorator](./02-structural/04-decorator.md) - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
5. [Facade](./02-structural/05-facade.md) - Provides simplified interface to a subsystem
6. [Flyweight](./02-structural/06-flyweight.md) - Shares common state efficiently across objects
7. [Proxy](./02-structural/07-proxy.md) - Controls access to original object

### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns
1. [Chain of Responsibility](./03-behavioral/01-chain-of-responsibility.md) - Passes requests along a chain
2. [Command](./03-behavioral/02-command.md) - Turns request into a stand-alone object
3. [Iterator](./03-behavioral/03-iterator.md) - Accesses elements sequentially 
4. [Mediator](./03-behavioral/04-mediator.md) - Reduces dependencies between objects
5. [Memento](./03-behavioral/05-memento.md) - Captures and restores object state
6. [Observer](./03-behavioral/06-observer.md) - Notifies dependents about changes
7. [State](./03-behavioral/07-state.md) - Alters object behavior when state changes
8. [Strategy](./03-behavioral/08-strategy.md) - Defines family of interchangeable algorithms
9. [Template Method](./03-behavioral/09-template-method.md) - Defines skeleton of algorithm
10. [Visitor](./03-behavioral/10-visitor.md) - Separates algorithm from object structure
11. [Interpreter](./03-behavioral/11-interpreter.md) - Implements a specialized language

## ✨ Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns offer several benefits:

- **📋 Proven solutions**: They represent solutions that have been refined over time by many developers
- **🗣️ Common vocabulary**: They provide a common language for developers to discuss designs
- **🚀 Higher abstraction**: They allow thinking at a higher level about software design
- **♻️ Reusable architectures**: They promote code reuse and maintainability
- **🔄 Improved flexibility**: They make systems more adaptable to change

## 📖 How to Use This Section

Each pattern is documented with:
1. Intent and use cases
2. Structure with UML diagrams
3. PHP implementation examples
4. Benefits and drawbacks
5. Real-world examples
